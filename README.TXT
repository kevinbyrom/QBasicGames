GRAKO QUEST 2 README FILE

Hello and thanks for trying out Grako Quest 2.
This file just has a few things that may help you out.

By the way if you like this game then give a copy to all your friends.
Then bring a copy to school or work and put a copy on all the computers.
Then go stand outside and hand out copies.  Umm... nevermind.

STARTING GRAKO QUEST 2

If you can't get Grako Quest 2 to start, then there are a few things you
should know.  First of all, you need Qbasic to run the main program.
Qbasic is a programming language that comes with DOS, so check your DOS
directory for qbasic.exe or qb.exe.  Second of all, you need to know how to
start it.  At the DOS command prompt, get to the directory where Grako Quest 2
is by typing in CD DIRECTORYNAME where DIRECTORYNAME is the name of the
directory you downloaded it to.  (the directory that this readme file is in)

Now, at DOS, type in:
GRAKO2
(then press enter)

This should work.  If it doesn't, because maybe you have a version of Qbasic
with a filename other than qbasic.exe, then run your version of Qbasic
from the directory that GRAKO2.EXE is located in, open main.bas, and run it.
You must run Qbasic from the directory with GRAKO2.EXE because that directory
has other files that need to be present when the game is run.  Get it?

If you have Windows 95, then this should work: (it hasn't been tested though)
Click on Start, look through the different programs you have that came with
Windows 95, and somewhere you should find Qbasic (I think it's under
applications or something).  Start Qbasic, open the file main.bas that came
with Grako Quest 2, and read the first few lines in the file.  They'll tell
you what to do.
