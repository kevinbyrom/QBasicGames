'€      Thank you for downloading HELLPIT II from FIG.  This is the sequel to€
'€ HELLPIT I.  This is not the final HELLPIT game; there is one more left in €
'€ the trilogy.  This is the longest HELLPIT game.  This game will always go €
'€ different; you have different choices.  This game only has ONE save file. €
'€ HELLPIT III will have two save files.  I would really, really appreciate  €
'€ any comments, questions and criticisms that you may have of this game, so €
'€ please e-mail me.  Please do not edit this file in any way.  I don't ask  €
'€ any money for this game, but in return I ask that you leave the files     €
'€ alone.  There are many new features in this game, such as a two-player    €
'€ magic attack and a secret three player magic attack.  There is also a new €
'€ game + feature, where you can start a new game with old stats, and a new  €
'€ unique HP counter.  Have fun with this game!                              €
'€      P.S There are two secrets in the game, so if you want them, then you €
'€ have to e-mail me with comments on the game!                              €
