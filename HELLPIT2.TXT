        Welcome to HELLPIT II.  I hope you enjoy this RPG.  This was made on 
QBasic from Mid April '97 to Early June '97.  Personally, I think that this
game is the best QBasic game that I've ever made.  This game was based on
HELLPIT I.  To get HELLPIT I, look in AOL for it, or e-mail me and ask for it.
To get a strategy guide on HELLPIT I and II, e-mail me with comments about the
game.  I strongly encourage you to pass HELLPIT I before starting this game.
This game only has one save file, but to make you happy, I have put a "NEW
GAME " feature, or in other words, a feature that lets you start a new game"
with previous game stats.  For any explanations of the source code, e-mail me
with thoughts on the game, and I will be glad to help.  To join FIG Inc.,
e-mail me with a sample of your work, and tell me what type of games you like
to program.  I will not reject anyone from entering FIG Inc. 
        
        I have many other QBasic games, some not on AOL, but if you e-mail me
and ask for them, I will send them to you.  None of my games require any
registration, but some of my games ask for an e-mail about the game, and I
will give you a personalized copy of the game and/or a better version of the
game.

        Make SURE that you always use HELLPIT2.bat!!!!!
