€±     FIG Inc. presents HELLPIT III: Final Flame                           €±   
€±                                                                          €±
€±     The final game of the trilogy, HELLPIT III is finally done!  This is €±
€± good and bad news.  The good part is that it is finally done, and you can€±
€± play it.  The bad part is that this is the final HELLPIT game.  But, I   €±
€± think that you will be glad to hear that I will take out all of the bugs €±
€± for each HELLPIT, add a couple of secrets, put a strategy guide for all  €±
€± three HELLPITS, tell EVERY SINGLE SECRET, and upload a zip file of all   €±
€± three HELLPITS and all of the above mentioned.                           €±
€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€±

  Please use HELLPIT3.bat to play HELLPIT!

  If you are a BASIC programmer that is interested in joining FIG, you may
   do so by e-mailing me at PANTERA55@aol.com with a sample of your BASIC 
   work, and a little bit about what type of games you like to play and what
   kinds of games you like to program

  When you beat the game, a "secrets" screen will come up, telling you each
   of the secrets in the game.  These secrets make the game fun to play
   even after you pass it

  If anyone is interested on starting a new HELLPIT series, you may do so
   as long as you are a part of FIG Inc.  I would love to see a new HELLPIT
   series
