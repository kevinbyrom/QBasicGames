        This game is a medium sized RPG with good graphics, originality,   
magics, experience, levels, hitpoints, magicpoints, bosses, etc.
        The object of this game is to get all three of the hearts, and then
try to defeat Satan.  It is really fun, and it should take about 2.5 hours to
5 hours to pass.  I will continue the saga by making HELLPIT 2, and we'll see
if I continue after that.  This was the game that I enjoyed most to program.
I have had a lot of help from people on AOL, and I thank you people for this
help.  If you would like to make a game with me, e-mail me at PANTERA55@aol.
I am always willing to make a game with others.  
        If you're not running this game through the .bat file, you may have
some problems trying to SAVE or LOAD the game.  That is why I recommend you
to run this game using the file HELLPIT1.bat.  If you still have troubles,
just e-mail me.
        If you have problems beating the game, then your problem is you.  I 
can't help you in that.  Besides, this is an EASY RPG anyways.  Don't alter
these files in any way PLEASE!
        If anyone wants to upload this game to a BBS, do it, but don't take
credit for my hard work (please!).  This game took me long to program.
