TO START:
1. Exit Windows or OS/2.
2. Start QBasic. (You may run it from DOSShell.)
3. From the File menu, choose Open.
4. Open the file SLOTS.BAS.
5. Press F5 to run.
6. To quit QBasic, choose Exit from the File menu.
   IMPORTANT: If you are prompted to save changes, say NO.

NOTE: Files with the extension .SSG are your saved games.

THE GAME: After the intro screen, you will see a scoreboard on the left, and a
box on the right. The box is the display; the scoreboard displays your score, a
list of available keys, and a list of possible combinations. 

YOUR BET: Your bet can be either $1 or $2 (default is $1). You can change your 
bet by pressing C. Your chances of winning are the same for both bets, but so
are your chances of losing.

SPINNING: To spin, press S. The display on the right will show you what you
spun. If you have won anything, you will hear a sound and a message will tell
you what you got.

RIGGING: It is possible to rig the game with a secret keystroke. If you are a
good enough programmer, you should be able to find out by scanning the code.
A warning: the game not only keeps track of whether the game is rigged or not,
but also whether the game has been rigged since the last time you reset the 
game. This can cause some difficulties which you will hear about later.

NEW GAME: To start a new game, press N. This resets the score to 0, turns 
rigging off, and resets the "has been rigged" thing mentioned earlier.

SAVING AND LOADING GAMES: To save a game, press A. To load a saved game, press
L. Games can be described by 8 characters. If you type a period in the name, or
if you try to load a game that does not exist, you will recieve a nice little
error message and you will have to restart the program. Saved games record your
score, and whether the game has been rigged or not. (Ha! You're not going to
fool me with that one!)

ENDING THE GAME: The game ends when one of four things happens: you reach 
$10,000, you reach -$10,000, you trigger an error (see above), or you get tired
and quit. If you reach $10,000 or -$10,000, you will see a special screen. If
you get an error, the screen will not appear to be very special at all. If you
get tired and quit (by pressing Q), your screen may appear fuzzy because of 
eyestrain. In any case, you will see the high score list. If you beat a score,
you will get to put your name in. If you type quotation marks in your name ("),
something bad will happen, so don't do it. Oh, by the way: if you have rigged
the game, you don't get to put in your name, even if you have beaten all the
scores. Which means that your saved games that have been rigged are useless,
too. Sorry.
